Built an ML model which performs Price Prediction on Bengaluru house price dataset from Kaggle using hyperparameter tuning, Gridsearchcv and K-fold cross-validation.
In course of model building, explored and executed data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection, and removal, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction.
Technology and tools used :
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook as IDE
